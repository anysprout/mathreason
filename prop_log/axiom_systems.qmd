title: "Axiom Systems"
---

Finally we can say something about axiomatic systems. In order to discuss this, we should have in mind a few examples of axiomatic systems.

Note that I will present these systems at a relatively introductory and intuitive level -- we will not say anything very detailed, about how to use them, or what they mean.

# Examples of Axiom Systems

## Euclidean Geometry

Euclidean geometry is the axiom system which describes most of the familiar ideas of geometry. It is made from the following list of axioms.[^1]

[^1]: These are largely adapted from Hartshorne's *Beyond Euclid* textbook.

1.  There are some three points which are not colinear.\
2.  For any two points there is a unique line which runs through them.
3.  For any line it contains at least two points.
4.  A line segment can be prolonged indefinitely.
5.  For any two points there is a circle which is centered on one of the points and passing through the other.
6.  For any line and point not on the line, there exists a line parallel to the first line, which runs through the point.

Here is an example proposition which can be proved from them:

::: {.callout-tip title="Two Lines, One Intersection" appearance="minimal"}
Theorem: Any two lines intersect in at most one point.

Proof: Suppose for contradiction that some two distinct lines, $\ell_1,\ell_2$, intersect at some two distinct points, $P_1,P_2$. Then by defintion, $P_1\in \ell_1$ and $P_2\in \ell_1$, and also $P_1\in\ell_2$ and $P_2\in\ell_2$.[^2]

By axiom (2.) applied to the facts $P_1\in\ell_1,P_2\in\ell_1$, there is a *unique* line running through $P_1$ and $P_2$, and so it must be $\ell_1$. This just means that if any other line runs through these two points, then it must equal $\ell_1$.

But since we also have $P_1\in\ell_2,P_2\in\ell_2$, then from what we said immediately above, $\ell_2$ must be the same line as $\ell_1$.

But this is a contradiction, since our assumption was $\ell_1\ne\ell_2$ but we have now derived $\ell_1=\ell_2$.

Since the assumption that "there are some two lines which intersect at some two points" led to a contradiction, then therefore this must not be true. That is to say, we have proved that any two distinct lines must intersect in at most one point.

$\Box$

[^2]: Note that this uses set membership notation, and this is no accident. While you should feel free to read "$P_1\in\ell_1$" as "point $P_1$ is on line $\ell_1$" -- it is also correct to say $P_1$ is an element of the set $\ell_1$, because we will understand lines to be sets of points.

Euclidean geometry just is the set of all "logical consequences" of the axioms. That is to say, Euclidean geometry is the set of propositions which are entailed by the set of axioms.

## Peano Arithmetic

Here are the axioms of Peano arithmetic:

1.  0 is a natural number.
2.  Every natural number has a successor.
3.  If two numbers share the same successor then they are the same number.
4.  0 is not the successor of any number.
5.  Induction is valid.

I'm sure that especially axiom number 5 seems provocative! We will have much more to say about it in the chapter on [First Order Logic](..\fol\pred.html), but for now I just want to show the various axioms systems at an introductory level. So we won't currently worry about exactly what is meant by these.

Here is a very simple example theorem.

::: {.callout-tip title="Two Successors" appearance="minimal"}
Theorem: If two numbers have different successors, then they are different numbers.

Proof: Suppose $m,n$ are two natural numbers and $S(m)\ne S(n)$.

Suppose for contradiction that $m=n$. Then $S(m)=S(n)$ but this contradicts $S(m)\ne S(n)$.

Therefore $m\ne n$.

$\Box$

## Vector Spaces

Although the reader is likely familiar with Euclidean geometry (which is really, pretty much the same as standard geometry in the plane), and natural numbers, the reader may not be familiar with vector spaces. However, vector spaces are perhaps the most fundamentally important object in all of mathematics. So whomever you are out there, hi! If you've made it this far, you should definitely learn a little bit of vector space stuff!

Vector spaces are not intrinsically geometric, but it is easiest to warm up to them if you start with a geometric view. We can start with the plane.

These arrows are each vectors. We primarily conceive of vectors as emanating out of the origin and pointing to some point in space.

However, they don't have to start at the origin -- a vector can start anywhere and terminate anywhere. So for instance you can see the yellow vector, which starts at the tip of the red vector, in the animation above.

Note that vectors are represented by a list of coordinates. The red vector is the same as $\begin{bmatrix}-1\\-3\end{bmatrix}$, and here you probably feel no sense of mystery. But the yellow matrix is $\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix}$, and this may seem strange. Notice that the start- and end-points of this vector are $(-1,-3)$ and $(0,-2)$. The coordinates of the vector is then the end-point coordinates, minus the start-point coordinates.
