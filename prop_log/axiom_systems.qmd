Finally we can say something about axiomatic systems.  In order to discuss this, we should have in mind a few examples of axiomatic systems.

# Euclidean Geometry

Euclidean geometry is the axiom system which describes most of the familiar ideas of geometry.  It is made from the following list of axioms.  

1. There are some three points which are not colinear.  
2. For any two points there is a unique line which runs through them.
3. A line segment can be prolonged indefinitely.
4. For any two points there is a circle which is centered on one of the points and passing through the other.
5. For any line and point not on the line, there exists a line parallel to the first line, which runs through the point.
