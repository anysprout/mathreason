The entire discussion will only consider natural numbers (i.e. positive whole numbers) since the idea of even and prime only make sense for natural numbers.[^1] That is to say, in this section, assume that every number in it, is a natural number.\n\n[^1]: This is not entirely accurate. It is possible to talk about even integers, but we won't worry about this right now.\n\nRecall that a number is even if it is divisible by 2. A number is prime if it is greater than 1, and its only divisors are \"interesting\". A divisor of a number is uninteresting if it is 1 or the number itself.\n\nSo for instance 3 is prime because it is greater than 1 and its only divisors are 1 and 3. But both 1 and 3 are uninteresting divisors of 3. On the other hand 4 is not prime because it has an interesting divisor: 2.\n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"List Primes\" appearance=\"minimal\"}\nExercise:\n\nList the first five prime numbers.\n:::\n\nTo prove that there is one even prime, we will use an argument called \"proof by contradiction\". The strategy of a proof by contradiction is:\n\n-   Assume a proposition which we think is actually false.\n\n-   Use the proposition to prove a contradiction.\n\n-   Therefore, the proposition must be false, because it leads to a contradiction. -->\n\nBelow is a proof that the sum of two positive numbers is always positive.  It starts from the assumption that this is *not* true.  That means that we start by assuming that some two positive numbers do *not* sum to a positive number.  We will then derive a contradiction, and therefore show that the assumption was false.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Positive Sum of Positives\" appearance=\"minimal\" }\nFor contradiction, assume that there are some two positive numbers which do not sum to a positive number.  Call these numbers $a$ and $b$.  Since they are positive, $0<a$ and $0<b$.  And since they do not sum to a positive number, then $a+b\\le 0$.  \n\nFrom $0<b$ we can infer $-b<0$ by subtracting $b$ from both sides.  Then from $a+b\\le 0$ we can infer $a\\le -b$.  But since we have $a\\le -b$ and also $-b<0$ it follows that $a<0$.  Therefore $a$ is not positive.  \n\nBut we established earlier that $a$ is positive.  Hence we have a contradiction: $a$ is both positive and not positive.  \n\nThe assumption that \"there are some two positive numbers which do not sum to a positive,\" led to a contradiction.  Therefore the assumption must be false.\n\nThis shows that any two positive real numbers must sum to a positive number.\n\n$\\Box$\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"Negative Sum of Negatives\" appearance=\"minimal\"}\nUse proof by contradiction to show that the sum of two negatives is always negative.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"Negative Irrational\" appearance=\"minimal\"}\n\nA number is called **irrational** if it is not rational.  A number is rational if it can be expressed as $p/q$ where $p$ and $q$ are two integers and $q\\ne 0$.  \n\nUse proof by contradiction to show that if $x$ is irrational then so is $-x$.  \n\nHint:  Fill in the following argument, where blanks are marked with `%TODO`.\n\n> Assume, for contradiction, that `%TODO`.  Then $-x$ can be expressed as $p/q$ where $p$ and $q$ are two integers, $q\\ne 0$.  That is to say, $-x=p/q$.

Because it is even, then there must exist some positive natural number $k$ such that $p=2k$. But this shows that, by definition, $p$ is divisible by 2. Since $p$ is not equal to 2, then this must mean that 2 is an interesting divisor. In turn, this means that $p$ is not prime.\n\nBut at the start we assumed that $p$ was prime, and therefore we have a contradiction: $p$ is both prime and not prime.\n\nSince the assumption that \"there is an even prime number other than 2\" leads to a contradiction, then it must be false.
