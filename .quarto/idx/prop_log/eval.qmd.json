One variable evaluation of this proposition is given by $P^{\\mathcal E}=F,Q^{\\mathcal E} = T, R^{\\mathcal E}=F$.

Usually we write \"the value of the function $f$ on input $x$\" as $f(x)$.

Make sure that you explain why the official definition of a variable evaluation requires $\\text{Var}\\subseteq V$ in order to make sense here.\n:::\n\n# Evaluations\n\nOf course we are not just interested in assigning values to the variables. We are ultimately interested in observing how variable assignments determine a value for the proposition. Returning to the example above, what value does $\\mathcal E$ determine for the proposition $P\\lor (Q\\lor R)$? Well of course we already calculated this in the truth-table, and found that the value is $T$.\n\n## True = 1, False = 0\n\nTo give this an official, technical definition, it will help if we make the identification that $T$ is actually just a symbol for the number 1, and $F$ is actually just a symbol for the number 0. Indeed Python is designed in a way that reflects this reality \"under the hood\" of what $T$ and $F$ really are.\n\n```{python}\nprint(\"1 and 1 = \" + str(1 and 1))\nprint(\"1 and 0 = \" + str(1 and 0))\n```\n\nWhat the code above shows is that, instead of using booleans `True` and `False`, one could just as well use the numbers 1 and 0 instead, and the behavior will be the same. In particular, the `and` operator is comfortable being given inputs which are booleans or the numbers 0 and 1.[^3]\n\n[^3]: Python is also comfortable taking other numbers instead of booleans, but this is not important for our current purposes.\n\nBecause $T$ and $F$ can be regarded as simply the numbers 1 and 0, we will allow ourselves to therefore perform the usual arithmetic operations on them. That is to say, we will understand that $T+T = 2$ is a true equation, since it merely says $1+1=2$. Likewise $TF=F$ where we regard the concatenation on the left as multiplication, and so on. Therefore this equation is true because $1\\cdot 0=0$.\n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"Boolean Formulas\" appearance=\"minimal\"}\nIn order to compute a particular part of the truth-table for a conjunction, we use the rule that $T\\land T=T$ and $T\\land F = F$ and $F\\land T=F$ and $F\\land F=F$. But these just say the already familiar computations $1\\cdot 1=1$ and $1\\cdot 0=0$ and $0\\cdot 1=0$ and $0\\cdot 0=0$.

Let $\\alpha$ be a proposition and $\\mathcal E: V\\to\\{T,F\\}$ any variable evaluation for $\\alpha$. Define the extension of $\\mathcal E$, the function $\\mathcal E^*$, by:\n\n1.  If $P$ is any propositional variable $P\\in V$ then define $P^{\\mathcal E^*}=P^{\\mathcal E}$.[^4]\n\n2.  If $\\alpha$ is a formula of the form $\\neg \\beta$ then $\\alpha^{\\mathcal E^*} = 1-\\beta^{\\mathcal E^*}$.[^5]\n\n3.  If $\\alpha$ is $\\beta\\lor\\gamma$ then $\\alpha^{\\mathcal E^*} = F$ if $\\beta^{\\mathcal E^*}=F$ and $\\gamma^{\\mathcal E^*}=F$. Otherwise $\\alpha^{\\mathcal E^*}= T$.\\\n\n4.  For definitions when $\\alpha$ is $\\beta\\land\\gamma,\\beta\\to\\gamma,$ or $\\beta\\leftrightarrow \\gamma$, see the exercises below.\n\n[^4]: This merely says: If you want to evaluate a propositional variable, then just use the variable evaluation. So for instance if $\\mathcal E$ evaluates $P^{\\mathcal E}=T$, then in the extended evaluation, $\\mathcal E^*$, it does exactly the same thing to $P$. Namely, $P^{\\mathcal E^*}=T$.\n\n[^5]: Explanation: Take for example $\\alpha=\\neg P$. In this case, then, $\\beta=P$. Also consider this, with variable evaluation $\\mathcal E$ which evaluates $P^{\\mathcal E}=T$. <br> What should we then say is the value of $\\neg P$? Well it's the negation of $T$, which is $1-T$ which is $F$. The rule above reflects this, by saying that $(\\neg P)^{\\mathcal E^*} = 1-P^{\\mathcal E^*}$ which is just $1-P^{\\mathcal E} = 1-T$.\n\nThis definition is often confusing to a student seeing this for the first time, so let's see the idea in practice -- hopefully if you see it used enough times, you'll actually come to see the definition as quite familiar.
