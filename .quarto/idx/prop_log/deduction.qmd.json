Therefore line 3 is allowed to derive $\\alpha\\lor\\beta$ from line 1, using the *Disjunction Introduction* inference rule. Because propositions merely \"accumulate\" as we go, then by the time we reach line 4, it is allows to use all of the lines before it, to derive a new line. In this particular example, it uses lines 2 and 3 with the inference rule for *Disjunction Elimination*.\n\nIn a two-column proof, every line must contain both a proposition and a \"justification\". That justification can be either (1) premise, for propositions in the premise of the deduction, or (2) any inference rule, applied to lines earlier in the proof.\n\nSince there is a deduction from premise $\\{\\alpha,\\neg\\alpha\\}$ to proposition $\\beta$, we express the existence of this deduction by writing $\\{\\alpha,\\neg\\alpha\\}\\vdash\\beta$.

There is no conditional introduction rule! The reason for this omission is that the conditional introduction rule requires a new technique that we will introduce here.\n\nIt is perhaps easiest to simply give a demonstration. Suppose that we would like to prove $\\{P\\lor Q\\} \\vdash \\neg P\\to Q$. Intuitively, the argument would go like this: \"*Suppose* that $\\neg P$ is true. Well then, we now have $\\{P\\lor Q,\\neg P\\}$ as our premise. In that case we can use *Disjunction Elimination* to infer $Q$. Since the supposition of $\\neg P$ leads to $Q$, we can therefore infer that 'If $\\neg P$ then $Q$.'\"\n\nThis is effectively a \"subproof\". That is to say, we assume $\\neg P$ and then conduct a proof of something (in this example, that \"something\" is $Q$). At the end of the subproof, we then \"export\" a conditional proposition. The conditional has, as its antecedent, whatever we assumed for the subproof. It has as its consequent, whatever the subproof ended with. In the two-column system we would represent the subproof like this:\n\n$$\n\\definecolor{subtl}{rgb}{.95,.95,.85}\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \\hline\n\\text{No.} & \\text{Prop} & \\text{Reason} \\\\\\hline\n1. & P\\lor Q & \\text{Premise} \\\\ \\rowcolor{subtle}\n2. & \\neg P\\to Q & \n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \\hline\n\\text{No.} & \\text{Prop} & \\text{Reason} \\\\\\hline\n2.1. & \\neg P & \\text{$\\to$ Assumption} \\\\\\hline \\rowcolor{subtl}\n2.2. & Q & \\lor\\text{E}, 1, 2.1 \\\\\\hline\n\\end{array} \\\\\\hline\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nNotice that the justification for line 2 is the subproof. Also notice the system that we adopt for numbering lines in a subproof. In the subproof on line number 2, the reason is $\\lor$E, 1, 2.1. What this means is that, of course, line 1 contains $P\\lor Q$. But where is 2.1? It is on line 2 of the main proof, but inside of line 2 we refer to line 1 of the subproof there. This is where we find the proposition $\\neg P$.\n\nAnd indeed, from $P\\lor Q$ and $\\neg P$ we are able to infer, with *Disjunction Elimination*, the proposition $Q$. This is what I have entered at line 2.2.\n\nHere's another example where I prove that $\\{P\\to Q\\}\\vdash \\{P\\to (R\\lor Q)\\}$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\\hline\n    \\text{No.} & \\text{Prop} & \\text{Reason} \\\\\\hline\n    1. & P\\to Q & \\text{Premise} \\\\\\hline \\rowcolor{subtle}\n    2. & P\\to (R\\lor Q) & \n        \\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\\hline \n        \\text{No.} & \\text{Prop} & \\text{Reason} \\\\\\hline\n        2.1. & P & \\text{$\\to$Assumption} \\\\ \\rowcolor{subtl} \n        2.2. & Q & \\to\\text{E}, 1, 2.1\\\\\n        2.3. & R\\lor Q & \\lor\\text{I}, 2.2 \\\\ \\hline\n        \\end{array}\\\\\\hline\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nAgain notice how this works: We want to prove $P\\to (R\\lor Q)$, so we make a subproof with assumption $P$ and ending at $R\\lor Q$.\n\n### Restrictions on Conditional Proof\n\nI have not yet really specified the rules of conditional proof, because they can be somewhat difficult to understand. For now I have mostly tried to communicate the method by examples. However, take the following example which demonstrates that this technique is invalid if used in the wrong ways.\n\n## Proof by Contradiction\n\nThere is a second proof method which uses subproofs. This is proof by contradiction. Consider the following argument which illustrates the technique.\n\n> We will prove that there is no largest number. For contradiction, suppose that there is a largest number and call it $x$. Then $x+1$ is a number and larger. Therefore $x$ is both largest (by assumption) and not largest (because there is a larger number). This is a contradiction. Because the assumption that there is a largest number produced a contradiction, then the assumption must be false. So there is no largest number.\n\nThe idea is that we\n\n1.  Assume the *negation* of what you hope to prove. (e.g. \"there *is* a largest number\")\n2.  From the assumption, derive a contradiction. (\"$x$ is largest and not largest\")\n3.  Therefore end the subproof, and infer what you wanted to prove. (\"there is *no* largest number\")\n\nBelow I'll illustrate this technique in a two-column proof that $\\{P\\lor Q\\}\\vdash \\neg P\\land\\neg Q$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\\hline\n\\text{No.} & \\text{Prop} & \\text{Reason} \\\\\\hline\n1. & P\\lor Q & \\text{Premise} \\\\ \\rowcolor{subtle}\n2. & \\neg P\\land \\neg Q & \n  \\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\\hline\n  \\text{No.} & \\text{Prop} & \\text{Reason} \\\\\\hline\n  2.1. & \\neg(\\neg P\\land \\neg Q) & \\lightning \\text{Assumption}\\\\\\hline\n  \\end{array} \\\\\\hline\n\\end{array}\n$$","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nEntailment is about which propositions \"make\" other propositions \"necessary\".
