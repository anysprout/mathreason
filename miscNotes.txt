Consider that a pizza might be sliced in 
5, 6 (captures 2 & 3), 7, 8 (captures 4) or 9 ways

1. Each individual should be full
2. An individual must eat 1/4 of a pizza to be "full"
3. If n individuals are not full, another pie must be ordered
4. Ideally, there should be no remaining slices
5. An individual may not eat more than 1/2 of a pizza
6. Each individual should receive the same # of slices

for n individuals, what is the ideal number of slices


slices = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
scores = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]


numPeople = 1000

while numPeople > 0
	foreach person in numPeople
		foreach slice in slices
			modScore = person % slices
			if
