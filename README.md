# How to Become a Mathematician

This is a web book made up of Quarto files.  You can view the web page hosted at `https://axiomtutor.quarto.pub/mathematical-reasoning-2023/`.  If you want to complete the programming exercises in a code notebook, you can download the project files and compile them in Quarto (through either VSCode or RStudio).
